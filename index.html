  <h2>----INTRODUCTION----</h2>
  <p>Learning HTML and CSS is hard, but it doesn’t have to be. This 14-chapter tutorial is one of the friendliest HTML and CSS guides on   the Internet. We’ll walk you through everything from selecting a good text editor (which is surprisingly important) to building full-fledged, professional-quality web pages from scratch.

 Diagram: a person creating web pages We designed HTML & CSS Is Hard to be the only introduction to HTML and CSS that you’ll ever need. 
If you put in the effort to read every section and write every code snippet, this tutorial has the potential to replace hundreds or even thousand of dollars worth of online courses and live training
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for complete beginners to become professional web developers, so if you’ve never written a line of HTML or CSS, but you’re contemplating a career shift, grab a cup of coffee, take a seat, and let’s get to work.

<h2> -------HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT--------</h2>
<blockqutations>
<P>HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript are the languages that run the web. They’re very closely related, but they’re also designed for very specific tasks. Understanding how they interact will go a long way towards becoming a web developer. We’ll be expanding on this throughout the tutorial, but the gist of it is:
 <br><br>
HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.CSS is for formatting that marked up content.
 <br><br>
JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive.
Think of HTML as the abstract text and images behind a web page, CSS as the page that actually gets displayed, and JavaScript as the behaviors that can manipulate both HTML and CSS.

<h2>-------WEB PUBLISHING-------</h2>
<p>So, what is it to “learn” HTML and CSS? We like to look at it through a historical lens into the printing industry. Back in the days of the original printing press, printers created documents by arranging metal characters, dipping them in ink, and pressing them onto a piece of paper.
<br><br>
In a lot of ways, that’s exactly what web developers do, except instead of arranging moveable type, they write HTML and CSS. We’re concerned with the same task as they were: conveying content in meaningful ways. We even deal with the same presentational issues they did, like selecting the font to use, setting the size of headings, and determining the space between lines of text.</p>

<br>
<h2>-------ATOM TEXT EDITOR------</h2>
<p>We recommend the Atom text editor. It’s user friendly even for beginners, provides all the useful features we mentioned above, and is available for all major operating systems. It’s also infinitely configurable, which will become important as you identify repetitive tasks that you can automate.
<br><br>
If you don’t already have Atom, go ahead and download it now, since you’ll be needing it for the next chapter. Once you’ve downloaded it, open it up so we can take a brief tour of its major features. You should see two panes with different welcome screens:
<br>
<img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/atom-welcome-screen-a59275.png" style="width:30%">
<br>
We don’t need either of these welcome screens, so close both of them by clicking the x icon in their corresponding tabs. You can also use the Cmd+W (Mac) or Ctrl+W (Windows/Linux) shortcut to close them (shortcuts are great, use them whenever you can). You should be left with a single untitled tab.</p>
